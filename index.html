                <h2 class="">What I actually help with</h2>

                <p class="">I’m trained to look for the places where systems
                    break under pressure.</p>

                <p class="">In service businesses, that’s often a manual
                    handoff, a memory-based task, or a step that works fine until things get busy.</p>

                <p class="">I apply that same clear, structured thinking to
                    how work flows through your business.</p>

                <blockquote class="">Sometimes the fix is adding a bit of
                    structure so nothing falls through the cracks.<br />Sometimes it’s automating a small, specific
                    step.<br />Sometimes the best advice is to change nothing.</blockquote>

                    <li>A short intro conversation</li>

                    <li>A simple review of how work currently flows</li>

                    <li>Small, scoped improvements, only if they’re actually useful</li>

                <h2 class="">About me</h2>

                <p class="">I’m a software/firmware engineer by background,
                    now focused on helping small service businesses improve reliability and reduce operational stress.
                </p>

                <p class="">I don’t approach this as a tool installer or AI
                    salesperson. I approach it as a systems thinker, looking for the smallest changes that create the
                    biggest relief.</p>

                <p class="">My goal is simple: help owners feel more in
                    control as their business gets busy.</p>

                <p class="">If you’re curious whether there are places your
                    operation could be simpler or more reliable, feel free to reach out.<br />No pressure. No sales
                    pitch. Just a conversation.<br /></p>
